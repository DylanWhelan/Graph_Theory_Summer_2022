# Graph_Theory_Summer_2022

My name is Dylan Whelan, ATU student no: G00381563 and I have created this repository for my Graph Theory summer repeat.

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks, one dealing with Graph Isomorphism and one dealing with the Heapsort

If you wish to run the notebooks on your own computer, you will need to install Anaconda distribution, you will then need to clone this repository to a directory on your pc.
Once you have the directory, you will need to open jupyter notebook from Anaconda and navigate to the directory and open the notebooks in Jupyet.
